      If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you
      report it to the Dev Edmonton Society Board by emailing conduct AT
      devedmonton DOT org.
      <strong>All reports will be kept confidential.</strong> In some cases we
      may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the
      case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential
      unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2">
      <strong>
        If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate
        law enforcement first.
      </strong>
      If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please
      include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2">In your report please include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc">
      <li class="py-1">
        Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow
      </li>
      <li class="py-1">
        Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If
        there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as
        well.
      </li>
      <li class="py-1">
        When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
      </li>
      <li class="py-1">
        Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record
        (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a
        link.
      </li>
      <li class="py-1">
        Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
      </li>
      <li class="py-1">If you believe this incident is ongoing.</li>
      <li class="py-1">Any other information you believe we should have.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold py-2 border-b border-lightgrey">
      What happens after you file a report?
    </h2>
    <p class="py-2">
      You will receive an email from the Dev Edmonton Society acknowledging
      receipt immediately. We promise to acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
      (and will aim for much quicker than that).
    </p>
    <p class="py-2">
      The working group will immediately meet to review the incident and
      determine:
    </p>
    <ul class="py-2 list-disc">
      <li class="py-1">What happened.</li>
      <li class="py-1">
        Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
      </li>
      <li class="py-1">Who the bad actor was.</li>
      <li class="py-1">
        Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to
        anyone's physical safety.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="py-2">
      If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical
      safety, the working groups' immediate priority will be to protect everyone
      involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe
      that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2">
      Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make
      a decision as to how to response. Responses may include:
    </p>
    <ul class="py-2 list-disc">
      <li class="py-1">Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).</li>
      <li class="py-1">
        A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s)
        involved.
      </li>
      <li class="py-1">A public reprimand.</li>
      <li class="py-1">
        An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a
        mailing list or IRC).
      </li>
      <li class="py-1">
        A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Dev Edmonton Society
        spaces (mailing lists, Slack, Github, events, etc.)
      </li>
      <li class="py-1">A request for a public or private apology.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="py-2">
      We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with
      either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet
      resolved.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2">
      Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original
      reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take
      into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our
      response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.
